However, it has potentialities for future new construction, since it lies adjacent to new developments of a very high character in Summit. This has already spread into the Borough of New Providence along Mountain Avenue, which is rolling, wooded, and scenic countryside. Another potentially favorable factor for this part of the area is that the Bell Telephone Laboratories within the past ten years acquired a tract of about 200 acres along Mountain Avenue near the Summit line, and intend some day to establish experimental laboratories there which will undoubtedly be accompanied by high grade home construction to house officials and technicians. Several houses in the $25,000 class and upwards are now located in this vicinity. The north side of the area is also sparsely settled, but with smaller type homes of sound construction. The land here is gently rolling, and being close to Summit, has definite future possibilities for residential development. Schools and churches are within the area, but shopping is mostly done in Summit Center, two to three miles distant. The main streets are hard surfaced, and Springfield Avenue is the principal thoroughfare. All city facilities are available, except that the sewerage system does noe extend to vacant or very sparsely settled parts.",

Mountain Avenue at the south boundary line of the area is a main thoroughfare (Route 29) from Newark to New York. Bus transportation is fair, but it is only a little over a mile to the Westfield Station of the Central R.R. of N.J. Being a small town, no sewage system has been installed, and there is only a volunteer fire department. Nevertheless it is considered a desirable residential section by the white-collar business people living there because it has many favorable features. Among these are: quiet woodland (except along the highway at the edge of the area) with practically no traffic directly through the area, Watchung Reservation to the north, Echo Lake Park to the south (prepared well maintained picnic and playgrounds) Echo Lake Country Club proximity to Westfield (a highly desirably residentail community with fine shopping facilities) adequate schools and churches. New building construction is of a very good character. There are no row houses, and the planning is good. During the course of construction, as much of the natural beauty of the woodland is retained as possible. Houses are somewhat older and less desirable than the average along New Providence Rd., and on Central Avenue.",

Houses are scattered throughout the area for the most part, but there is a concentration around South Street. Types are very mixed, and there are even a few shacks and dilapidated houses unworthy of the general average. On the whole, houses are fairly well maintained by the occupants, most of whom are employed in very extensive greenhouses adjacent to the south. With the exception of the main thoroughfares, streets are unfinished, and there are no sidewalks. Schools, churches, and neighborhood stores are adequate. All city facilities are afforded except that the sewerage system does not extend to the vacant or more sparsely settled parts of the area. Bus transportation is good to Summit and points east, and the Murray Hill Station of the DL&W Railroad is near. Being sparsely settled with fairly old and obsolete small homes and an unlikely location for future new development at least for ten or more years, the section is a fair third grade area.",
